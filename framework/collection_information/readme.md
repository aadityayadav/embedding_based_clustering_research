More details about the collections can be found here: https://github.com/gagolews/clustering-data-v1/tree/master/.catalogue

eval_collections.json can be used as an input for framework/embedding_test.ipynb

Note: The collection's incorporate multiple datasets with varying amount of samples. Do not use the entire eval_collections.json at once, especially for testing, as it will take too much time.
